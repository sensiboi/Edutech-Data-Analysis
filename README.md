This project focuses on analyzing an EdTech dataset to explore various application attributes and their relationships using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques. It includes preprocessing steps like cleaning, encoding, and scaling, followed by the development of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes. The models are compared based on evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from data exploration to model evaluation — providing insights into the performance of predictive algorithms in an EdTech context.
